# Hello, and welcome to the Raj Lab!

We've gathered together a list of resources to help you get started on our awesome team. Collections of papers, video lectues, Minerva help, etc. Just select the section you'd like to peruse and follow the links posted in the respective READMEs.

This resource is still in it's early stages so everyone feel free to make contributions that may be helpful to others.

Good Luck!
