## Step 0. Do you need the thing?

If you're not sure, talk to Towfique.
Commonly requested things are keyboards, mice, screens, external hard drives, dongles etc.


## Step 1. What do you need?

We use [CGWD](https://www.cdwg.com/). Find what you need there.

## Step 2. Fill out the Google Sheet

Maojuan keeps track of our orders in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AE33lJxxazRkb-tXnEJ6e51OYMVizdExk2AEYIGxva4/edit#gid=0).

Create a new row to the sheet, adding all the relevants fields, including the CGWD part number.

## Step 3. Email Maojuan, cc'ing Towfique

Email Maojuan Zhuang (your MSSM email will find her) and let her know you need something. 
Make sure to CC Towfique so he knows what's going on.

## Step 4. Receive the thing!

When the item has been shipped, Maojuan will email you.
